# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge 5 -- Work Day Schedule

## Description

This is my submission for the fifth challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this challenge was to create an interactive daily schedule with JavaScript.
The website presents you with a column of timeslots color-coded based on the current time and allows you to save custom messages in them.
